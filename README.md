## Overview

I wanted to create the simplest file + data combo I could find for a single page app for some of my photos. I decided to try and do everything in a single html file as a challenge using a single JSON file to handle the photography data. I also wanted to demonstrate a simple use of the Fetch API. _Note: that means for this to work you have to upload the files to a server_.

The CSS is declared in a `<style>` element between the `<head>` and the `<body>` element. The Javascript is declared after the `<footer>` element and before the closing `</body>` element.
